# Description:
A showcase of my work as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. This repository reflects my journey in applying data science techniques to solve business challenges and extract actionable insights from data.

# Contents Include:

* In-depth analysis of datasets with Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

* Machine learning models built using scikit-learn, XGBoost, and more.

* Projects tackling problems like customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, and price prediction.

* Well-structured notebooks and code for easy understanding and reproducibility.

# The key accomplishments include:

* Predictive Modeling: Built machine learning models achieving over 90% accuracy in classification and regression tasks.

* Data Analysis: Analyzed datasets with over 100K records, extracting actionable insights for decision-making.

* Data Visualization: Developed intuitive visualizations to present complex data stories, making them accessible to non-technical audiences.

# Key Highlights:

* Application of machine learning techniques to solve classification and regression problems.

* Clustering methods for data segmentation and pattern recognition.

* Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib,and Jupyter Notebook.

* Emphasis on reproducibility and clear documentation for each project.


### DATA SCIENCE TASKS:

 **TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

  - SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset
  - TASK: The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
