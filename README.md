### DATA SCIENCE TASKS:

 **TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**

  - SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset
  - TASK: The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

## TASK 2
<img src ="https://github.com/Gtshivanand/CodeAlpha-Datascience_Intership/blob/main/Task2-Unemployment%20Analysis%20with%20Python/Images/Task2%20Description.jpg"/>
- Project: **UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON**
- Description: Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
- Dataset Provided: [Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)
- Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Plotly, calender and datetime  
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at

## TASK 3
<img src="https://github.com/Gtshivanand/CodeAlpha-Datascience_Intership/blob/main/Task3-Car%20Price%20Prediction%20with%20Machine%20Learning/Images/Task3%20Description.jpg"/>
- Project: **CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING**
- Description: The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
- Dataset Provided: [Car data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)
- Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, datetime, and scikit-learn
- Models used: Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost Regressor and Linear Regression  
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at

- [Github Link](https://github.com/Gtshivanand/CodeAlpha-Datascience_Intership/tree/main/Task3-Car%20Price%20Prediction%20with%20Machine%20Learning).

## TASK 4
<img src="https://github.com/Gtshivanand/CodeAlpha-Datascience_Intership/blob/main/Task%204-%20Sales%20Prediction%20using%20Python/Images/Task4%20Description.jpg"/>
- Project: **SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON**
- Description: Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. Complete the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
- Dataset Provided: [Advertising Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv)
- Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.
- Models used: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at
